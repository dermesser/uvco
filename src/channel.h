/// A `Channel` is similar to a Go channel: buffered, and blocking for reading
/// and writing if empty/full respectively.
///
/// A bounded-capacity channel for items of type `T`. A channel can be waited
/// on by at most `max_waiters` coroutines. If more coroutines want to wait,
/// an exception is thrown.
///
/// A reader waits while the channel is empty, and is awoken by the first
/// writer. A writer waits while the channel is full, and is awoken by the first
/// reader.
///
/// When only using a channel to communicate small objects between coroutines,
/// it takes about 1 Âµs per send/receive operation on a slightly older
/// *i5-7300U CPU @ 2.60GHz* CPU (clang 17) using the `RunMode::Deferred` event
/// loop mode. This includes the entire coroutine dance of suspending/resuming
/// between the reader and writer. (`RunMode::Immediate` is ~25% faster)
///
/// Caveat 1: the channel is obviously not thread safe. Only use within one
/// loop. Caveat 2: As you can notice, the Channel is independent of a `Loop`.
/// This means that a `runMain()` may return despite there being channels in use
/// and awaited on. Ensure that at least one uv operation (socket
/// read/write/listen, timer, etc.) is running to keep the loop alive.
